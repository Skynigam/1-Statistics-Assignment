If it is measured on an interval scale (e.g. in centimeters), they would use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups. However, if it is measured on a ratio scale (e.g. in inches), they would use a different test called an independent samples t-test. If the researcher doesn't understand the level of measurement of the height data, they may use the wrong test and draw incorrect conclusions about the differences between the two groups."
